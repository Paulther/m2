![Ising model](ising-triangular.png "Specific heat") <br />
The Ising Model of Ferromagnets provides a framework to numerically calculate the temperature of phase transition. This code calculates specific heat as a function of temperature, the peak of which represents the critical temperature. The code is an augmentation of Professor Rozmans code which makes the same calculation with a square lattice instead of a triangular lattice. The code was also changed to scan over multiple temperature, instead of making calculations of energy and magnetic susceptibility for one particular temperature. The simulation shows that the critical temperature is around 3.6 in dimensionless units.<br />
The first change that was made to the original code was changing the lattice geometry to a triangular lattice from a square lattice. The only difference between the square lattice and the triangular lattice is the number of neighbors each atom interacts with. The next change made to the code was adding a loop over multiple temperatures. The loop was fairly basic. The only tricky piece of the loop was recalculating the boltz,an factors at each temperature.
